			 PNGJ  Version 0.1
			   Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

PNGJ is a simple Java library for reading and writing PNG images.
See docs and examples attached.


Version 0.1  (January 2009)
-----------------------
- Full reading/writing capabilities for truecolor formats: RGB/RGBA , 8 and 16 bpp
- Other formats: paletted and grayscale images implemented (almost no testing), 
only with 8bitdepth resolution (1,2,4 bits not implemented). 
- Palette handling: very rudimentary: PngReader only reads the raw chunk and 
PngWriter -if applicable- writes it back.
- Special color transformations (ICC) : unvisible for the API. The chunks are
read and write 'raw'. 
- Special chunks: limited support for Physical resolution (DPI) and textual chunks.
All other ancillary chunks are blindly read and write.
